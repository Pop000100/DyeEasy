Have you ever wanted Dyes to be easier to craft?
No...? You only use Strange Dyes? OK then.
But I'll tell you what this mod does anyway!
 -One dye ingredient now gives you 3 Dyes (e.g. 1 Red Husk = 3 Red Dye)
 -When combining recipes, you now get the same amount of dye that you used in the recipe (e.g. 1 Yellow Dye + 1 Orange Dye + 1 Red Dye = 3 Flame Dye)
 -Bright Flame, Intense Rainbow, Bright Silver and Lunar dye recipes are unchanged.
Hopefully now you'll at least give regular old dyes a chance!
